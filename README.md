# ChimpVisual
A 3D Visualization of a Constrained Hidden Markov Process (CHiMP)

### How to run
Open `index.html` in a web browser. Make sure to enable CORS so the webpage can access local files (otherwise run a local webserver to serve `index.html`).

### Libraries and other code used

The WebGL library: [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org) is used in conjunction with a ThreeJS extensions from [SeregPie](https://github.com/SeregPie/THREE.TextSprite) and a javascript animation library, TweenMax.
